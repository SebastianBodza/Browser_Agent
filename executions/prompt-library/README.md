# Prompt Library (10 Examples)

These are automatically generated reusable `prompt.md` files for browser-agent runs. 100% Codex-generated be warned :) 

Each prompt is designed to produce:

- `PASS: TRUE/FALSE`
- step-by-step execution log
- linked screenshots and video
- final report in the run folder

Examples are intentionally diverse (research, compliance, monitoring, extraction, and UI reliability).
